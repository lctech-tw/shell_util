# =======================
# WHAT IS THIS SCRIPT FOR
# =======================
# Given a project ID, this script completes a list of setup steps that are
# required to facilitate usage of the `gcloud [alpha|beta] compute instances
# ops-agents policies` commands. See the `WHAT DOES THIS SCRIPT DO?` section for
# more details.

# ==========================
# WHO SHOULD RUN THIS SCRIPT
# ==========================
# This script is designed for project OWNERS to run. Non-owner users may be able
# to run it if they have high-priveleged permissions. Reach out to your project
# owner for help if certain permission (e.g. enabling API for the entire
# project) is
# denied.

# ========================
# WHAT DOES THIS SCRIPT DO
# ========================
# Given a project ID, this script takes care of the following setup:
#
# 1. Enable the Cloud Logging API, the Cloud Monitoring API and the OS Config
#    API for the project. This is required for logs and metrics to be ingested
#    to the backend.
# 2. Grant the `roles/logging.logWriter` and the `roles/monitoring.metricWriter`
#    roles to the Compute Engine default service account of this project. The
#    Compute Engine default service account is automatically set up on GCE VMs.
#    Granting it these permissions allows the Cloud Operation Suite agents that
#    are installed by the policies on the GCE VMs in this project to write to
#    the Cloud Logging and Monitoring APIs to ingest logs and metrics.
# 3. Enable and verify the OS Config metadata for the project. This ensures the
#    OS Config Agent installed on each GCE VMs is active and ready to pull and
#    apply policies.
# 4. [Optional] Grant permissions to non-owner users or service accounts to
#    create and manage policies. Project owner(s) automatically have full access
#    to create and manage policies. For all other users or service accounts, the
#    project owner(s) need to explicit grant permissions to them. The available
#    options for the permissions are:
#    *  roles/osconfig.guestPolicyAdmin: Full access to the policies.
#    *  roles/osconfig.guestPolicyEditor: Edit access to get, update, and list policies
#    *  roles/osconfig.guestPolicyViewer: Read-only access to get and list policies.

# ============
# Sample usage
# ============
#
# A sample command that does 1, 2 and 3 as mentioned above:
# $  bash set-permissions.sh --project=PROJECT
#
# A sample command that does 1, 2, 3 and 4 (grant permission to a user):
# $  bash set-permissions.sh --project=PROJECT \
#      --iam-user=USER_EMAIL \
#      --iam-permission-role=[guestPolicyAdmin or guestPolicyEditor or guestPolicyViewer]
#
# A sample command that does 1, 2, 3 and 4 (grant permission to a service account):
# $  bash set-permissions.sh --project=PROJECT \
#      --iam-service-account=SERVICE_ACCT_EMAIL \
#      --iam-permission-role=[guestPolicyAdmin or guestPolicyEditor or guestPolicyViewer]

# ===============
# TROUBLESHOOTING
# ===============
#
# PERMISSION_DENIED errors
#
# If you see an error like:
#
#     WARNING: You do not appear to have access to project [PROJECT_ID] or it
#     does not exist.
#
# Make sure the project exists and you have access to it. Ask your project owner
# for help if needed.
#
# If you see an error like:
#
#     ERROR: (gcloud.services.enable) PERMISSION_DENIED: The caller does not
#     have permission.
#
# Refer to the `WHO SHOULD RUN THIS SCRIPT` section to make sure you are an
# owner of this project or ask the owner to grant you sufficient permission
# following https://cloud.google.com/service-usage/docs/access-control#permissions.

# Ignore the return code of command substitution in variables.
# shellcheck disable=SC2155
